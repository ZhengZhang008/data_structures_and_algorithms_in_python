- In general, what people need is not a procedure to solve a specific problem, but a procedure to solve a class of problems.
- The process of solving problems with computers is divided into two stages: the developer of the programme develops a programme for the problem to be solved, and the user runs the programme to deal with specific instances of the problem and perform specific calculations.
